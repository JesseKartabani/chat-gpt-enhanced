# ChatGPT Enhanced

Leverages OpenAI's GPT model (text-davinci-003) to generate natural language responses to user-provided prompts. This project extends the functionality of the original ChatGPT by adding speech-to-text capabilities and the control over the balance of logical and creative thinking in the AI to suit your needs. The user interface is built using React, allowing for an easy and efficient interaction with the AI-based service.
