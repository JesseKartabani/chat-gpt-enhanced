Leverages OpenAI's API to tap into the GPT (text-davinci-003) and Codex (code-davinci-002) models, enabling the generation of natural language responses to user prompts. Additionally, it enhances ChatGPT's functionality by incorporating speech-to-text and giving users control over the AI's balance of logic and creativity.
