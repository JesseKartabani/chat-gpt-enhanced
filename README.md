Leverages OpenAI's GPT model (text-davinci-003) to generate natural language responses to user-provided prompts. This project extends the functionality of the original ChatGPT by adding speech-to-text capabilities. The user interface is built using React, allowing for an easy and efficient interaction with the AI-based service.
